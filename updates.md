### Living in Denmark

- [x] Contract

Filled a form concerning my employment contract.
Need this for the OD1 formular to apply for a european residence certificate.

### Work - Software

- [ ] Volume of fluid method

To understand what is going on in a volume of fluid solver I try to implement the method of the paper [Volume of fluid (VOF) method for the dynamics of free boundaries](https://dcwan.sjtu.edu.cn/PlugIns/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Hirt%20%E5%92%8C%20Nichols%20-%201981%20-%20Volume%20of%20fluid%20(VOF)%20method%20for%20the%20dynamics%20of%20f(1).pdf).

While the text is fairly helpful and definitely worth reading, I am more of a hands on guy. That is why I used the [Create Your Own Finite Volume Fluid Simulation](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/create-your-own-finite-volume-fluid-simulation-with-python-8f9eab0b8305).

Partially implementation of the code, however I kind a wanted it nice and the therefore it got out of hand.

### Work - OpenFOAM

- [ ] OpenFoam

Since I will be working with OpenFoam quite a lot it is a good idea to familiarize myself with it.
First getting it installed and usable is a good idea.

### Living in Denmark

- [x] Informed the TK about my move to Denmark
- [x] Informed the DPG about my move to Denmark

### Work - Literature

- [x] Volume of fluid method, literature

Found a really nice paper from Gaybriel Weymouth, shouts out to [WaterLily.jl](https://github.com/weymouth/WaterLily.jl).
The paper is called [Conservative Volume-of-Fluid method for free-surface simulations on Cartesian-grids](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2009.12.018).

### Work - OpenFOAM

- [x] OpenFoam

Since I will be working with OpenFoam quite a lot it is a good idea to familiarize myself with it.
First getting it installed and usable is a good idea.
Have the default version 2112 installed on this laptop.

- [x] OpenFOAM in WSL

To run OpenFOAM on Windows I have to use WSL.
To access the home folder in WSL one has to look for "\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<username>". 
Need to find out to how to get the double backslash there.
